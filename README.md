🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis on Emergency Department Dataset
📊 Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pipeline conducted on an emergency department dataset. The analysis emphasizes data quality, distribution patterns, statistical relationships, and key operational metrics such as ED visits, diagnoses, and hospital attributes. Visualizations are used extensively to uncover trends and anomalies that can aid strategic decision-making in healthcare settings.

🏁 How to Run
1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scipy
2. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emergency-department-eda.git
cd emergency-department-eda
3. Update File Path
Update the dataset path in project.py:

python
Copy
Edit
file_path = "C:/Users/hp/Desktop/python_dataset.csv"
Replace with your actual CSV file path or place the CSV in the project directory and update the relative path accordingly.

4. Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python project.py
All plots will be saved to the eda_plots/ directory and a summary will be logged in eda_summary.txt.

📈 Sample Outputs
Heatmap of missing values

Boxplots post outlier treatment

Correlation matrix

Histograms of numerical features

Interactive scatter plot using Plotly

Regression analysis with slope, intercept, R² and p-value

🧠 Use Cases
Healthcare operations planning

Data-driven resource allocation

Early anomaly detection in ED visit patterns

Foundational layer for machine learning modeling

📌 Notes
Script includes automatic directory creation for plot storage.

Outliers are capped (not removed) to preserve dataset size.

Categorical variables are explored using count plots and cross-tabulations.
